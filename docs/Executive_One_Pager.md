# SAVI Bench — Executive One-Pager

- Problem: AI benchmarks are one-off, opaque, and non‑verifiable.
- Solution: SAVI Bench — continuous, transparent, cryptographically verifiable AGI benchmarking.
- Patent‑Pending Innovation: 4‑phase cognitive cycle (Warm‑up → Strength → Endurance → Competition) + tamper‑evident proof packs.

## Proof Points
- 10,000‑agent runs with strict $250 budget cap and manifest evidence (stop_reason=budget_cap_reached_250.0).
- Lower latency and cost per query vs baseline; reproducible success metrics.
- Hourly continuous validation since Sept 2025 with public artifacts and checksums.

## Call to Action
- DS005 Proof Pack and replay: https://github.com/FaithoverCP/savi-bench/releases/tag/DS005-20250908
- Scan QR to open DS005 (insert in materials):
  - PowerShell: `Start-Process https://github.com/FaithoverCP/savi-bench/releases/tag/DS005-20250908`
  - Optional: generate a QR PNG with Python: `pip install qrcode[pil] && python - <<<'import qrcode; qrcode.make("https://github.com/FaithoverCP/savi-bench/releases/tag/DS005-20250908").save("qr_ds005.png")'`
