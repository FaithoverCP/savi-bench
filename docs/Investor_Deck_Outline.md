# Investor Deck — Outline

1. AI Benchmarks Are Broken
- Opaque, cherry‑picked, non‑verifiable. No public raw data or manifests.

2. SAVI Bench Changes Everything
- Hourly, public, reproducible benchmarking; cryptographic proof packs.

3. Patent‑Pending Methodology
- 4‑phase cognitive cycle; budget‑aware runs with manifest evidence.

4. Live Demo (QR)
- Link to DS005 release; show human report + proof pack.

5. Numbers That Matter
- Success rate Δ vs baseline; p50/p95/p99 latency; cost per query; processed_tasks under cap.

6. Roadmap / Moat
- Continuous validation; expanding deterministic suites; third‑party verification.
